# Cross-platform Chat app using SocketIO, Flask and React Native

## Purpose

The purpose of this building this chat application is to teach myself the following skills:

1. Designing a simple mobile application from scratch
2. Cross-platform mobile UI development with React Native
3. Flask and SocketIO for backend development

## Use cases

1. Users can either create a new chat room or join an existing chat room.
2. User can invite others into their chat room.
3. Invitation is sent as a URL or a 6-digit code, which other users use to join the chat room.
4. Chat room acts as a group chat. All messages are broadcasted to the rest of the members.
5. (Theoretically) unlimited number of users in a single chat room.

## Libraries & Framework

UI developed using Expo, React Native and React Native Elements.

## Future plans

This is the first in the series of projects I take on to learn more about mobile development.
